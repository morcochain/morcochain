Feature: NuShare change is part of the keys exported to Peercoin
  Scenario: After shares are sent, the total outputs of the exported keys include the change
    Given a network with nodes "Alice" and "Bob" able to mint
    When node "Bob" generates a NuShare address "bob"
    And node "Alice" sends "1,000" NuShares to "bob"
    And node "Alice" reaches a balance of "9,998,999" NuShares
    Then the total unspent amount of all the Peercoin keys on node "Alice" should be "9,998,999"

  Scenario: Sending NuShares generates a single transaction
    Given a network with nodes "Alice" and "Bob" able to mint
    And node "Bob" generates a NuShares address "bob"
    And node "Alice" sends "1000" NuShares to "bob"
    Then node "Alice" should have 11 NuShares transactions
    And the 10th transaction should be the initial distribution of shares
    And the 11th transaction should be a send of "1000" to "bob"

    When node "Alice" finds a block received by all other nodes
    Then node "Bob" should have 11 NuShare transactions
    And the 10th transaction should be the initial distribution of shares
    And the 11th transaction should be a receive of "1000" to "bob"
