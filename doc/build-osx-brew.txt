Mac OS X Mountain Lion build instructions
How to build nud and Nu.app on 10.8


Prerequisites

Install Xcode from the App Store and launch it

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app

1.  Install the Command Line Tools from the Xcode Preferences under Downloads

2.  Install Homebrew from http://brew.sh

3.  Install dependencies from Homebrew

brew doctor
brew install boost berkeley-db4 openssl miniupnpc
brew link berkeley-db4 --force
brew link openssl --force
sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/lib
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib /opt/local/lib/db48

4.  Clone the github tree to get the source code

// todo: provide link to the repository as soon as it is publicly available


Building nud

1.  Run the makefile

cd nubit/src/
make -f makefile.osx RELEASE=true 64BIT=true CXX=g++

// To build with static linked libraries, use these commands:

ln -s /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/db48
cd nubit/src/
make -f makefile.osx RELEASE=true 64BIT=true STATIC=true DEPSDIR=/usr/local CXX=g++

Building Nu.app

You cannot use Qt 4.8.6 if you want to deploy to other systems
http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/41925

1.  Download and install Qt 4.8.5 from
http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-mac-opensource-4.8.5.dmg

2.  Download and install Qt Creator from http://qt-project.org/downloads

3.  Use Qt Creator to build the project

Double-click nubit/nu.pro to open Qt-Creator
Click the Configure Project button
Click on the monitor icon on the left bar above Debug and change it to Release
On the top menu, click Build and Build Project "nu"


Deploying Nu.app

Deploying your app is needed to run it on non-development systems

1.  Sym-link libraries

sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib /opt/local/lib/lib
sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/db48/libdb_cxx-4.8.dylib /opt/local/lib/libdb_cxx-4.8.dylib

2.  Copy Nu.app and run macdeployqt to bundle required libraries

mkdir deploy
cp -r build-nu-qt-Desktop-Release/Nu.app/ deploy/Nu.app/
sudo macdeployqt deploy/Nu.app/

3.  Fix a dependency path

install_name_tool -change "/opt/local/lib/db48/libdb_cxx-4.8.dylib" "@executable_path/../Frameworks/libdb_cxx-4.8.dylib" deploy/Peershares-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Nu

// deprecated, but still useful if you're going to send it around to a small audience.
// todo: update contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus to work with Nu

4.  Compress Nu.app into a zip

Right-click on Nu.app and click Compress
