# Setup
------
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/nu (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/nud (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/nu (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/nud (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 7890 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Nu works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Nu network.

# Resources
----------
Upgrade
-------
All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade, first backup wallet:
  nud backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown the daemon with:
  nud stop
Remove files inside wallet directory other than wallet.dat and nu.conf
Start up the new client. It would start re-download of block chain.
